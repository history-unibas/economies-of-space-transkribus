# Trankribus-API
This repository contains Python scripts for interacting with the Transkribus platform using their REST API.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer (only on Python 3.10 tested)
- Packages: see requirements.txt

## Notes
- These scripts were developed as part of the following research project: https://dg.philhist.unibas.ch/de/bereiche/mittelalter/forschung/oekonomien-des-raums/
- Information about the Transkribus platform can be found at https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/.

## collection_transcription.py
With this module, layout analysis and text recognition can be performed on multiple documents belonging to different collections.

## connect_transkribus.py
The script contains functions to interact with the REST API of Transkribus. Parts of this script are based on the github repository https://github.com/raykyn/TranskribusTagger.

## download_latest_pagexml.py
This script allows you to export the latest pagexmls of all Transkribus pages across multiple collections.

## htr_model_validation.py
Two transcription versions are analysed using this module. In our use case, a used transcript handwritten text recognition (HTR) model is validated with the gold standard (manual transcription). As comparative variables, the character error rate (CER) and word error rate (WER) are used.

## replace_characters.py
This script searches in a fixed Transkribus collection selected special characters within transcribed text and replaces them with defined characters. Some documents within the collection where excluded.

## change_status.py
This script can be used to change the status of the last version of several selected Transkribus pages. These pages can be located in different collections. In our use case, we have set selected pages to a specific status to exclude these pages from transcription.
